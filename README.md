# 🏴‍☠️ Windrose Captain's Chest

> *"A sturdy chest for any Windrose captain — full of logs, charts, and soundings to hand the port authority when things go sideways."*

A standalone PowerShell toolkit that gathers everything you'd want to know about a Windrose crew's rig in one pasteable report. Run it once, open the chest, hand the contents to whoever's helping you debug.

---

## ⚓ What's in the chest

**Ship's papers**
- Windows version, build, architecture
- CPU (model, cores, clock)
- RAM (total GB)

**Crow's nest (GPU)**
- Name, driver version, VRAM
- Driver date and **age warning** — flags drivers over 6 months (INFO) or 12 months (WARN)

**Seaworthy check ⚓**
- Compares yer ship against Windrose's minimum and recommended specs
- **OS** — 64-bit check, Win10 (min) / Win11 (recommended)
- **CPU** — cores and clock speed vs i7-8700K (min) / i7-10700 (rec)
- **RAM** — 16 GB (min) / 32 GB (rec)
- **GPU** — tiered lookup table covering NVIDIA/AMD cards from GTX 900-series through RTX 50-series and RX 9000, with a "manual review" fallback for unknown cards
- **DirectX** — queries `dxdiag` for the version (needs DX12)
- **Storage** — checks free space on the Windrose install drive (or C: if not installed), 30 GB required
- **SSD detection** — warns if yer game drive is an HDD (Windrose strongly recommends SSD)

**Soundings (network)**
- Adapters, link speed, IP config, route table
- Home waters (local network profile: Public vs Private)
- **Flag on the mast** — public IP via three fallback endpoints
- Beacons to Steam, Cloudflare, and Google to confirm the sea lanes are open
- Hosts file contents

**Hold inventory (Windrose / Steam)**
- Auto-finds Windrose installs across every Steam library folder (parses `libraryfolders.vdf`)
- Hull markings — executable versions for `Windrose*.exe` / `R5*.exe`
- Salvages `Config/`, `SaveProfiles/`, `ServerDescription.json`, and up to 50 log files
- Watch posts — Steam/Windrose firewall application filters
- Crew roster — running Steam/Windrose processes
- Man overboard — recent Application log errors tagged Windrose/Steam/crash
- Powder magazine — installed Visual C++ runtimes

**Spyglass (optional remote soundings)**
- DNS resolution (if target is a hostname)
- Cannon shot — ICMP ping with average latency
- Boarding party — TCP port test on your specified port
- **Sounding the harbor** — auto-probes common ports 7777, 7778, 27015, 27036
- Ship's log — trace route (skippable)
- A straight note on UDP: PowerShell can't positively confirm UDP is open from the client side

## 🗺️ Output

Every run creates a timestamped chest at:

```
%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\WindroseCaptainChest\yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss\
```

Inside you'll find:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CaptainsLog.txt` | Full human-readable report |
| `CaptainsLog.md` | Markdown findings table — paste straight into Discord |
| `CaptainsLog_REDACTED.txt` | **Safe-to-share** copy with hostname/username/IPs/MACs scrubbed |
| `CaptainsLog_REDACTED.md` | Safe-to-share markdown version |
| `Manifest.csv` | PASS/WARN/FAIL/INFO findings, one per row |
| `Salvage/` | Recovered game configs and logs |
| `...zip` | The whole chest sealed for transport, next to the folder |

At the end of every run, you'll be asked whether to create the redacted copies. Post those (not the full log) when asking for help in public channels — they keep all the diagnostic data a helper needs while hiding your hostname, public IP, MAC addresses, and file paths behind `<REDACTED_*>` placeholders.

## 🧭 Usage

### Hoist sail (easiest — compiled exe)

Double-click `CaptainsChest.exe`.

On first run you'll see a few Windows prompts. **This is normal for unsigned community tools** — work through them and it'll stick for future runs:

1. **Windows Defender SmartScreen** — "Windows protected your PC"
   Click **More info** → **Run anyway**
2. **User Account Control (UAC)** — "Do you want to allow this app to make changes?"
   Click **Yes** (admin is needed for full firewall and event log access)
3. The pirate banner appears — chart yer course and follow the prompts

### ⚠️ Why does SmartScreen / my antivirus complain?

The exe is a PowerShell script compiled with a tool called `ps2exe`. Because some malware authors use the same tool, **Windows Defender and other AV products sometimes flag `ps2exe` output as a false positive**. Typical warnings:

- SmartScreen: "Windows protected your PC" (one-click past it)
- Defender: "Trojan:Win32/Wacatac" (false positive)
- Some AVs may silently quarantine or delete the file

### 🛡️ VirusTotal scan

Every release exe is uploaded to VirusTotal so you can verify for yourself. The current scan shows **6 out of 71 engines flagging the file**, all from minor vendors using generic heuristics (Bkav Pro, K7AntiVirus, SecureAge, Elastic, K7GW, Trapmine). Every major engine (Windows Defender, Avast, AVG, BitDefender, Avira, ClamAV, Kaspersky, ESET, Malwarebytes, Norton, Sophos) returns clean.

**[View the VirusTotal scan results](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/845c92017d0e104c68dfb33a51a80543443e1e6270b8f1c2b06a3628ecfe21a8)**

This is normal and expected for any `ps2exe`-compiled binary. The flagging engines are pattern-matching the ps2exe wrapper, not anything in the actual script logic.

**If you don't want to trust the exe, don't!** The source `CaptainsChest.ps1` is in the same zip. Open it in Notepad, read every line, and if it looks clean, run the `.ps1` directly:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\CaptainsChest.ps1
```

The source being right there is the point. This is a community tool, not a black box.

### Alternative: run the .ps1 directly

If you'd rather skip the exe entirely:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\CaptainsChest.ps1
```

Or unblock the file once and right-click → Run with PowerShell will work forever after:

```powershell
Unblock-File .\CaptainsChest.ps1
```

### Picking a mode

You'll be prompted to chart a course:

1. **Full voyage** — ship, shore, and sound out a distant port
2. **Quick sweep** — ship info and a quick port test
3. **Stay ashore** — ship and shore only, no remote soundings

### Non-interactive (scripted)

```powershell
.\CaptainsChest.exe -Mode Full -ServerIP 1.2.3.4 -ServerPort 7777 -NoPause
.\CaptainsChest.exe -Mode LocalOnly -NoPause
.\CaptainsChest.exe -Mode Full -ServerIP crew.example.com -SkipTraceRoute -NoPause
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-OutputPath` | Where to drop the chest | `$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\WindroseCaptainChest` |
| `-ServerIP` | Server IP or hostname to sound | prompted |
| `-ServerPort` | Port to test | `7777` |
| `-Mode` | `Full`, `Quick`, `LocalOnly` | prompted |
| `-SkipTraceRoute` | Skip tracert (saves ~30s) | off |
| `-SkipNetworkTests` | Skip all remote tests and public IP lookup | off |
| `-NoPause` | Don't wait for Enter at the end | off |
| `-Redact` | Auto-create redacted copy without prompting | off |
| `-NoRedactPrompt` | Skip the redacted-copy prompt entirely | off |

## 👮 Admin rights

- **Running the `.exe`**: automatically prompts for admin via UAC. Click Yes.
- **Running the `.ps1` directly**: not required, but recommended. Without admin you'll miss some firewall rule details and a chunk of event log entries. The report tells you its admin state up top so the dockmaster knows what's in the manifest.

---

## 🕵️ A word on privacy

The report contains:

- Your computer name and username
- Your local and public IP addresses
- Hardware identifiers (MAC addresses, GPU names)
- File paths on your machine
- Hosts file contents

Give `CaptainsLog.txt` a once-over before posting it in a public channel. If you need to scrub anything, the markdown summary (`CaptainsLog.md`) is usually enough for most troubleshooting without handing over the full log.

## 🎯 Port presets

Tested by default whenever you supply a target. Edit the `$script:WindrosePortPresets` block at the top of the script if yer charts differ.

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 7777 | UDP/TCP | Default game port and Direct IP host mode |
| 7778 | UDP | Secondary game port |
| 27015 | UDP/TCP | Steam query / master |
| 27036 | UDP/TCP | Steam streaming / P2P |

---

## 🆘 Direct IP fallback

If Fleet check shows Connection Services are unreachable, Windrose can still be hosted through **Direct IP** mode instead of the backend service path. The report now prints this as a fallback when the backend is fully unreachable or when partial reachability points to 3478 / ISP-side Connection Services trouble.

Use this path in game:

```
Host a Game -> Direct IP tab -> port 7777
```

Then share your public IP with your crew. This bypasses Windrose Connection Services entirely, but it still requires **port 7777** to be open on your router.

## 📋 Windrose system requirements (what Seaworthy checks against)

| Spec | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 (64-bit) | Windows 11 (64-bit) |
| CPU | Intel i7-8700K / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X | Intel i7-10700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X |
| RAM | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| GPU | NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti / AMD RX 6800 | NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD RX 6800 XT |
| DirectX | 12 | 12 |
| Storage | 30 GB (SSD recommended) | 30 GB (SSD required) |

The developers note that Windrose is in Early Access and these numbers are **not final**. Self-hosted servers need additional RAM on top. If the game updates its specs, edit `$script:WindroseSpecs` at the top of the script.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
- Internet connectivity (for public IP lookup and remote tests)

No external modules. No installs. Single file.
